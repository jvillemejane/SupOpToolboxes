[Collaboration](#collaboration)## General Info***MP3_DF_MiniPlayer*** is a **MBED OS** library developed for the *MP3-TF-16P* module. ![](https://content.instructables.com/F1S/VFJQ/J6IF520P/F1SVFJQJ6IF520P.jpg)This module is a MP3 Player able to read SD card and USB key. You can control it by a simple USART connection at 9600 bauds.This directory contains :- *MP3_DF_MiniPlayer.h* / *MP3_DF_MiniPlayer.cpp* files : library files to include in your MBED OS project- *main_MP3_DF_MiniPlayer.cpp* file : an example of using this Library- *images* directory : images used for this tutorialBECAREFUL !!!**Data stored on the SD card must be formatted as follow !**### Audio Files in root directoryAudio files directly stored in the __root directory__ of the storage device(SD card or USB flash drive) need to berenamed as 0001.mp3/0001.wav, 0002.mp3/0002.wav, 0003.mp3/0003.wav### MP3 and ADVERT directoriesThere are two special purposed folders “MP3” and “ADVERT” that can be chosen by usersto use or not according to the actual needs. Audio files stored in these two folders need to be renamed as0001.mp3/0001.wav, 0002.mp3/0002.wav, 0003.mp3/0003.wav, .......3000.mp3/3000.wav.### Other directories and audio filesOrdinary folders must be renamed as 01, 02, 03......99, and the audio files must be renamed as001.mp3/001.wav, 002.mp3/002.wav, 003.mp3/003.wav, .......255.mp3/255.wav. It is also possible to keep theoriginal name when you rename a file. For example, the original name is “Yesterday Once More.mp3”, then you canrename it as “001Yesterday Once More.mp3”.## RessourcesTo obtain more informations about the MP3 TF 16P module, you can check the [Datasheet](https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobotDFPlayerMini/blob/master/doc/FN-M16P%2BEmbedded%2BMP3%2BAudio%2BModule%2BDatasheet.pdf)For beginners who starts programming with **Keil Studio** or **MBED Studio** on embedded STM32 targets, check this **series of tutorials** about [Nucleo board / Step by step programming](http://lense.institutoptique.fr/nucleo/)## InstallationTo use this library, you have to copy *MP3_DF_MiniPlayer.h* / *MP3_DF_MiniPlayer.cpp* files into the *libs* directory of your **MBED Studio** or **Keil Studio** project.Then you have to include the header file (*MP3_DF_MiniPlayer.h*) into your main code with the command :```c#include "MP3_DF_MiniPlayer.h"```## How To Use## CollaborationThis library was written by **Julien Villemejane** @jvillemejane for embedded programs on *STMicroelectronics* Nucleo L476RG board.  The last modification : **Julien Villemejane** - 17/mar/2023
